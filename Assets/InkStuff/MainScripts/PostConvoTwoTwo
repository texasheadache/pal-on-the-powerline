Ever heard of Andy Warhol? #molly
Pop art? #molly 
That whole thing? #molly
Some people #molly
- critics or hobbyists or whatever - #molly
they say that the whole thing is just meaningless. #molly
Like, that those copies and copies of Marilyn #molly
or the can of soup or whatever #molly
that apparently meant something to somebody, #molly
that in the end they added up to next to nothing. #molly
There were just so many. #molly
It's kind of scary. #molly 
But I guess that's the point, right? #molly
Because didn't it all kind of represent some sort of cold efficiency? #molly
The American dream personified - endless cans of soup? #molly
Seemed it to me, #molly
anywats, I really don't know #molly 
- I wasn't even asked the question. #molly #g
