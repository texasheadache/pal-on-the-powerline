Hello? #molly #secondConvoSong
Hey? #phone
Yeah #phone
Sorry about that. #phone
Where'd ya go? #molly
Phones disconnect. #phone
Mess up. #phone
Wires are crossed. #phone
You know how it goes. #phone
Anyhow #phone
here I am. #phone
Right. #molly
Still at the directories? #phone
You haven't made a single movement since I dropped off. #phone
Yeah...#molly
Say, #molly
since you're like #molly
a phone and all...#molly
can you hear other phone calls #molly
or does your existence only extend over my line? #molly
Just yours. #phone
Don't get too nosey. #phone
Anyways, #phone
you were calling someone? #phone
Yeah. #molly
Just a friend. #molly
He's really nice and lets me talk a lot #molly
and I think I might like him. #molly
Like, "like" like him. #molly
And y'know#molly
- we know how that goes - #molly
around him, #molly
around anybody like that,#molly
something feels caught in the back of your throat#molly
- like hard candy. #molly
But you don't choke, #molly
it doesn't hurt. #molly
It feels good. #molly
So, I'm looking for the number, #molly
and I just begin flipping through the directory, y'know? #molly
Get to where I wanna be. #molly
But that's my first mistake, see, #molly
because immediately I find myself looking down #molly
at a spreadsheet of everyone I know #molly
- and I feel really far away, #molly
like i've never even met these people. #molly
Take .j;j. - I see him in there  #molly
he's right here, see? #molly
Name and number. #molly
Same with everybody else. #molly
And I feel like I'm looking at their backs,#molly
against a wall. #molly
Everyone looks the same, spelled out like that. #molly
Even j,,j,j,,j - #molly
even he looks exactly like everyone else scrunched down that list. #molly
Just reading his name does not do it for me. #molly
And I know - I could call him. #molly
Wouldn't that be something? #molly
Nevermind that I had to slosh through the factory floor #molly
of a thousand identical nameplates to get there - #molly
I made it out the other side, #molly
only to stare down the one thing I wanted. #molly
And isn't it fucking torture? #molly
'Cause I'll turn around #molly
and walk right out the door I came in through. #molly
Well, yeah. #phone
The whole thing is supposed to be very efficient. #phone
And yeah - #phone
that's the realm of machines. #phone
I guess it could feel a little overwhelming to people. #phone
But that goes for j;j;j;j; as well. #phone
Who knows? #phone
He could be talkin' to his phone right now too. #phone
Unlikely #molly
You said it yourself though, #phone
you said "I don't think it's a stretch, #phone
to imagine people like that". #phone
To imagine. #molly
And I do. #molly
I do imagine people like that. #molly
That's easy. #molly. 
Doesn't mean I'm right. #molly #endSecondConvo #endSecondConvoSong
