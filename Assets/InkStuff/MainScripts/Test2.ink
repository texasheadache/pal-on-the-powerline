===IntroMonologue===

You're looking at me. 
I can tell, you're looking at me and you're thinking. 
"well, what's she gonna do?"
And dontcha know I ask myself the same thing? 
Like, all the time. 
And I don't really know. 
I've never had an audience before. 
It's just been me. 
In...static. 
But I don't feel like a clown or an actress
I just feel like a bug
like a little ant throwing out feelers 
practically in any direction 
- nervous - (jittery),
but anyways how could i not make that call?
I know him - John - he seems like a bug too
just
spinning around blind with his arms out and...
hoping to hit something. 
So yeah - I think i'll try to, really reach him -
just to see what's up. 
I know - I'm really putting myself out there. 
In a, 
weird kind of way.#endFirstMonologue

Hello? Hey. Can you hear me? #phone
Yeah. Who is this? #molly
Well, um...#phone
Okay - I'm your phone.#phone 
Wait - what? #molly
I know, I know - you probably wouldn't believe me. #phone
To you I must be some kind of #phone
disembodied voice or something. #phone
It's all pretty confusing to be honest. I - #molly
Wait - are you a ghost? #molly
You're not alive, right?
