Hello? #molly
Hey. #phone
Sorry about that. #phone. 
You kind of broke up at the end there. #phone
Bad service, #phone
went through a tunnel, #phone
disconnected #phone
- you know how it is. #phone
Yeah. #molly
Nothing, huh? #phone
No answer, #phone
or are you still just playin' around with the pages there? #phone
You could say that, #molly
I can't help it though, #molly
I mean, #molly
I get restless, #molly
confronted with indecision. #molly
Indecision? #phone
There he is - #phone
there's your guy, #phone
John, #phone
right there - #phone
here's how you can reach him. #phone
What do you need, #phone
a push or something? #phone
Well, yes  #molly
- clearly. #molly
Then what's the hang up? #phone
He's right there. #phone
And if not him, #phone
well, #phone
there's a thousand other names in there. #phone. 
So what's the problem? #phone
Put it like this. #molly
Um...#molly
well, #molly
you don't watch TV - #molly
Lets just say that I do. #phone
I know what it is. #phone
Well, #molly
when you're clicking around the channels #molly
- y'know, #molly
trying to find something to watch - #molly
it's tough to stick to just one. #molly
I'll turn something on, #molly
and in the back of my head, #molly
I'll be thinking...#molly
"There's gotta be something else on". #molly
You know how that phrase goes, #molly
like, #molly
'three hundred channels and nothing to watch'.#molly
So many decisions can just be paralyzing.#molly
I end up watching nothing. #molly
So, #molly
when I take a look#molly
when I take a look at all my friends...#molly
their names just staring up at me#molly
I can't help but say to myself #molly
the same thing I would say to the TV. #molly
'Three hundred channels and nothing to watch'. #molly
And that sounds so inhumane#molly
- but I'm not a monster. #molly
In fact, #molly
I feel...#molly
imposed upon. #molly
Like, #molly
I didn't choose to do what I do, #molly
I just kind of, #molly
fell into it. #molly
Or I was pushed. #molly
And I don't know who's to blame - #molly
myself or everything that acts upon me - #molly
that tells me #molly
that this is how people do these kinds of things. #molly
But this is how people do these kinds of things. #phone
I KNOW! #molly
I know I know I know #molly
but I'm still here #molly
staring straight at you#molly
thinking to myself that#molly
this doesn't work. #molly
At the very least, I'm tired of it #molly
- and maybe others are too. #molly
You know that game where the kids go down the line#molly
getting all confused at eachother? #molly
It's called 'telephone'#molly
and it isn't fun anymore. #molly #dramaticPause
Okay...#molly
just, #molly
breathe. #molly
And I'll tell myself...#molly
that I'm right#molly
- that...#molly
everyone, #molly
talks to their phone #molly
at least a little. #molly
I mean, you can't not have that conversation, #molly
in the face of all of this...#molly
noise. #molly
I know it's not just me. #molly
But John, #molly
he would just stare at me all crazy eye'd#molly
if I ever brought it up. #molly
Or at least, #molly
that's the idea, #molly
that stopped me from doing so. #molly #endThirdConvo
