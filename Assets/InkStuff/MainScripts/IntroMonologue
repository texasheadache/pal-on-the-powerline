You're looking at me. #molly
I can tell, you're looking at me and you're thinking. 
"well, what's she gonna do?" #molly
And dontcha know I ask myself the same thing? #molly
Like, all the time. #molly
And I don't really know. #molly
I've never had an audience before. #molly
It's just been me. #molly
In...static. #molly
But I don't feel like a clown or an actress #molly
I just feel like a bug #molly
like a little ant throwing out feelers #molly
practically in any direction #molly
- nervous - (jittery), #molly
but anyways how could i not make that call? #molly
I know him - j.j.j.j. - he seems like a bug too #molly
just #molly
spinning around blind with his arms out and... #molly
hoping to hit something. #molly
So yeah - I think i'll try to, really reach him - #molly
just to see what's up. #molly
I know - I'm really putting myself out there. #molly
In a, #molly
weird kind of way. #molly #endFirstMonologue
