Hello? #molly #firstSong
Helloooo?#molly
Hello? Hey. Can you hear me? #phone
Yeah. Who is this? #molly
Well, um...#phone
Okay - I'm your phone.#phone 
Wait - what? #molly
I know, I know - you probably wouldn't believe me. #phone
To you I must be some kind of #phone
disembodied voice or something. #phone
It's all pretty confusing to be honest. I - #molly
Wait - are you a ghost? #molly
You're not alive, right? #molly
Are you even real? #molly
I really don't do ghosts and - #molly
No. #phone
No, no don't go saying that #phone
you're fine - I'm not a ghost. #phone
The what are you if not a ghost? #molly
You're a voice caught in the white noise of home electronics - #molly
sounds like a ghost. #molly
Really, I swear. #phone
I'm not a ghost. #phone
No...#molly
Okay, nevermind. #phone
Then just say that I popped in through the powerline. #phone
Okay, yeah #molly
we can go with that. #molly
So what's this? #phone
All these phonebooks#phone
yellow pages #phone
is that a middle school directory? #phone
What are you on? #phone
The letter "S". #molly
Dontcha think it's strange #molly
if I can pinpoint a specific person #molly
through...I dunno, a name #molly
or an address #molly
just a shred of basic info #molly
if I can get anything concrete than I can get to 'em #molly
...yeah, that's how it works. #phone
And doesn't that strike you as particularly odd? #molly
Not really #phone
isn't that what everybody does? #phone
I guess so #molly
but that doesn't mean that they can't think it odd either. #molly
If everybody thought something as odd #phone
and everybody agreed upon it #phone
then wouldn't something be done to make it go away? #phone
You would think. #molly
And it's still here #phone
I'm still here #phone
everywhere. #phone
So much for public opinion, right? #phone
Maybe...#molly
I do though, think that it's possible #molly
and even likely #molly
that for many #molly
you can't help but just do what's always done. #molly
Why? #molly
It's easy #molly
safe #molly
works well enough... #molly
Like, take this boy - John. #molly
I'm gonna call him up #molly
but if I had it my way #molly
they'd just drop me off at the door in a package. #molly
I mean, I am a people person #molly
but more like a people in person kind of person #molly
So, yeah  #molly
I think that some people do walk around #molly
with the thought in their head #molly
that, "Okay, some of the stuff I do to function regularly #molly
I'm not entirely comfortable with #molly
and I wish I wasn't tied to a routine I find alienating #molly
but what choice do I really have?" #molly
I don't think that it's a stretch #molly
to imagine people like that #molly #endConvoOne
