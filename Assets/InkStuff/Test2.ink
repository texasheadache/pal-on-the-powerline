You're looking at me. 
I can tell, you're looking at me and you're thinking. 
"well, what's she gonna do?"
And dontcha know I ask myself the same thing? 
Like, all the time. 
And I don't really know. 
I've never had an audience before. 
It's just been me. 
In...static. 
But I don't feel like a clown or an actress
I just feel like a bug
like a little ant throwing out feelers 
practically in any direction 
- nervous - (jittery),
but anyways how could i not make that call?
I know him - John - he seems like a bug too
just
spinning around blind with his arms out and...
hoping to hit something. 
So yeah - I think i'll try to, really reach him -
just to see what's up. 
I know - I'm really putting myself out there. 
In a, 
weird kind of way.
